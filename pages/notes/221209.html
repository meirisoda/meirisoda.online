            I want to be able to create more but I keep getting into mental blocks (not necessarily art block, more so a lack of desire to start anything and just feeling nothingness, which honestly might just be depression). Seeing other's works would normally inspire me to create, but I've been feeling inadequate instead. I also recently realized how much the medium of which I create my art through affects how I approach the creative process.
            <br /> 
            <br />Some things I would like to do:
            <br />➔ Learn Blender. I've been saying this for the longest time, and I keep telling myself I'd do it.
            <br />➔ Make my site cooler. I am happy with how my homepage looks but some of my pages look super boring and uninspiring. Why do I have to be so basic?
            <br />➔ Create music. Making electronic music has been a dream for me since I was in 5th grade but it's been over 10 years and I still haven't started. I'll figure something out. The goal is to work with analog synthesizers.
            <br />➔ Getting better at writing. 
            <br />
            <br />I feel like no matter what I create, it isn't good enough. And I feel the need to keep striving for higher standards and make cooler things. 
            I feel the need to always be at a more "complete" version of myself and compare myself to what I am not. I want to be okay with who I am now, in this current moment.
