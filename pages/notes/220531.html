            <h2>May 31, 2022</h2>
            I'm going to be treating this like a journal of sorts. I do have a physical journal that I think in, but when it comes to certain topics in which my brain moves way too fast for my hands, I need to type it out. And it's not really enough for me to keep it to myself. I'm alright with putting my deepest thoughts to the world. What's funny is that although I'm alright with putting everything I think out into the internet, I have a difficult time speaking directly to those closest to me and to myself. Speaking to this abstract concept of the 'internet', something that can't be fully quantified, is more comforting to me than speaking to another person. Honestly, it might be because unlike speaking to another person, putting my thoughts on the internet is less personal. And if I get a response online, I don't need to actually think about it deeply.
            <br />
            <br />Something I learned about myself recently was that I am afraid of confrontation. Confrontation from others and more importantly, confronting myself. Because when others confront me, I'm forced to confront myself and think about things. And I'm too scared to do that.
            <br />
            <br />Another thing I also wanted address today was the discrepancies between my perceived self, my desired self, and my current self. 'Want' isn't the correct term, 'need' makes more sense. I need to address the discrepancies between my perceived self, my desired self, and my current self.
            <br />
            <br />I am afraid to talk about who I believe myself to be because I know it is different from the way others perceive me. But I can't keep running away forever.
            <br />
            <br />I desire to be a private person. I want to be somebody that can keep my thoughts and internal world to myself. But I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm not that person. In fact, I desire to be known. I want external validation. I want people to tell me that they value my worldview and philosophy. This is related to my difficulty understanding that others have their own desires, meaning that I have a difficult time understanding that others have a world of their own. I live so within myself that I forget that others have their own interests, that others have things that they like and dislike, that others might want to do things of their own. I don't know why I feel so threatened or saddened whenever somebody wants to do something else. It's not because I see them as less important than I or that the things I am interested in or want to do are more valid than theirs. I'm really not sure why this is.
            <br />
            <br />The more I write, the more I realize that my desire to feel validated rules over a lot of my emotions.
            <br />
            <br />I am feeling this sudden rush of self-dislike because of this person that is very close to me. They are someone who keeps track of how they feel for extended periods of time. They know themselves and their emotions. They let themselves feel, whether it may be through journaling or through recording moments in their life. They let themselves confront themselves. And seeing that, knowing that I don't do that, makes me annoyed. Not at them, but at myself. I am annoyed at myself for feeling inadequate. I don't have to do what they do to be an emotionally mature person, and I'm sure they will tell me the same. I'm sure most people will agree. But I can't get past myself. Why do I feel so inadequate? Why do I feel that I need to do what they do, to feel that I have the same willingness to confront myself and face myself? To be at the same level of emotional maturity?
            <br />
            <br />I apologize for the disorganized writing (if you couldn't tell thus far, I am a very 'stream of consciousness' writer), but I think my brain is at a breaking point for today. I am feeling so incredibly empty. I am angry at myself. I'm angry at myself for only thinking of myself. And I'm angry that I'm angry. I don't even know what anger is. Is this frustration? What am I even doing?
            <br />
            <br />I need a break from myself.
