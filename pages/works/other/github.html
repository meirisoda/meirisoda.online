                <p>meirisoda.github.io was my first website. There are many iterations, 4 of which are live below:</p>

                    <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/1" target="_blank" class="clickb">meirisoda.github.io/1</a> 
                    <p>The first version of my website, and stylistically closest to the current site. As I was learning HTML, I didn't know the capabilities of CSS, and as such, the code is very messy (it is still messy). </p>

                    <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/2" target="_blank" class="clickb">meirisoda.github.io/2</a>
                    <p>Personally, my least favorite version. Lacks a cohesive body and unifying idea, and was a shallow attempt at creating a minimalist and "professional" website, ending up not representing me or my values at all.</p>
