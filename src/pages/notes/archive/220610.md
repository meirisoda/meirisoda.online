## Relationship with Technology
_June 10, 2022 â€” edited from original post_

I want to talk about my relationship with technology and the influence it has on my life. Recently I've been reading a lot of papers and essays written about the role of technology and its relationships to us, whether it may be websites, my phone, and other devices that are commonly used in society today. This entry will mostly be quotes and paraphrases, with comments in between.

First I want to talk about Laurel Schwulst's essay _My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be?_ on The Creative Independent:

I need clarity. Intention is important when creating a website. What do I want from creating this website? What kind of message, idea, or presence do I want this website to hold and how is an _extension_ of myself?

```
"Whatever it is, there's potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity."
```
```
"Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating everything-not only making things inside the world, but also the surrounding world itself-the language, style, rules and architecture. This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works ("the objects") but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!)" 
```

Prior to meirisoda.github.io, I used tumblr as a hosting page, a website of sorts. Although I was posting my artworks, my thoughts and things that I felt was a reflection of me, it never ended up being accurate representation of *who* I was. I wanted to create my own website from the ground up, to able to control and create pages and manipulate details as I best saw fit - in summary, a world.

I felt so much pride and joy after creating meirisoda.github.io. Learning html and css wasn't the greatest experience. But I do believe that webdev is a form of art and there is no reason for my website not to be an extension of who I am. The process of coding and seeing the site come into existence reminded me of the things I like to do, the slow, repetitive actions - the time and space I want to occupy.

```
"In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it's finite, often with a specific intended purpose. Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion."
```

My room is my sanctuary. It is a place that I feel safe in, and serves many functions. My desk has a wonderful view of the outside and lets in a lot of natural light, and lying in a corner are my monitors and CD player.

A website can be anything. It doesn't have to be a complete archive of my works. I would imitate other artists' professional pages in hopes of feeling professional and distinguished myself, but would find myself feeling emptier as it didn't represent who I was.

But there doesn't have to be a completed version of a website! It should grow with me.

```
"If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it's instrumental that websites progress along with us."
```
Creating my own space on the web. I am constantly finding and forging my own space.

Next are some pieces from _The Coming Age of Calm Technology_ by Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown (1996):

```
"What matters is not technology itself, but its relationship to us."
```
What role does my phone play in my life? The single piece of technology that holds great power over us - trying to reduce my reliance on my phone has proven difficult. What helped me find peace were older, often analog items with fixed purposes. I want specific functions for my devices, I've been purchasing CD players, I look into walkmans etc.

To me, the reason these devices feel a lot more natural and human, is because it becomes a physical manifestation or representation of the purpose itself. For instance, a wired headphone visually shows the music traveling from the source into your ears. You plug it in to begin hearing music. I don't know if that makes a lot of sense. But even as convenient wireless headphones are, wired headphones truly connect me to the music, and grounds me.

```
"But when computers are all around, so that we want to compute while doing something else and have more time to be more fully human, we must radically rethink the goals, context and technology of the computer and all the other technology crowding into our lives."
```

```
"Calm technology engages both the center and the periphery of our attention... First, by placing things in the periphery we are able to attune to many more things than we could if everything had to be at the center... Second, by recentering something formerly in the periphery we take control of it."
```

I couldn't help but think about _Ocean of Sound: Ambient sound and radical listening in the Age of Communication_ by David Toop. Some specific parts include:
```
 "...music in which a blankness prevails, ambient dread or bliss, clam and near silence, extreme minimalism, or a spacious landscape, a tropic or frozen atmosphere in which the listener can insert her or himself occupy the foreground, wander the imaginary space for hours at a time."
```
This next one in particular felt special to me:

```
"Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."
```
```
"...explore a restricted sound range or single technological process over long durations, seek to effect physiological change rather than pursue intellectual rigour, or depict impossible, imaginary environments of beauty or terror. Music that aspires to the condition of perfume, music that searches for new relationships between maker and listener, maker and machine, sound and context. Music that leads the lister into a shifting zone..."
```
```
"The result of calm technology is to put us at home, in a familiar place."
```

I hope that is what my website becomes. My home. A space curated for myself. My monitors and CDs are also home. My headphones are home. The partitions in my room separating my desk from my dresser. My door covering my clothesrack to allow for my space to be more open. They are my calm technology.
    
```
As we learn to design calm technology, we will enrich not only our space of artifacts, but also our opportunities for being with other people. When our world is filled with interconnected, imbedded computers, calm technology will play a central role in a more humanly empowered twenty-first century."
