    <h2>Learning to Love</h2>
    <i>November 11, 2022 — edited from original post</i>
    <p>
      The weather's getting colder and gloomier every day. I can definitely feel
      it affecting my mood and my general mental health, and it feels like I'm
      walking through fog. I don't want to be so gloomy but I can't help but
      feel that way.

      I have been learning how to love though. Love can mean a variety of
      things, but it also includes showing the people around me that I care and
      making them feel appreciated. People do frequently tell me to reach out
      more, but it's always been a difficult thing for me. I realized that the
      way I comfort people may not actually make them feel better. I want to
      work on how I show appreciation, how I comfort others, how I show my
      feelings to others - in a healthy way for both myself and the other
      person.
