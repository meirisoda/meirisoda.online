    <h2>Releationship with Technology</h2>
    <i>June 10, 2022 — edited from original post</i>

    <p>
      I want to talk about my relationship with technology and the influence it
      has on my life. Recently I've been reading a lot of papers and essays
      written about the role of technology and its relationships to us, whether
      it may be websites, my phone, and other devices that are commonly used in
      society today. This entry will mostly be quotes and paraphrases, with
      comments in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      First I want to talk about Laurel Schwulst's essay
      <i
        >My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could
        Yours Be?</i
      >
      on The Creative Independent:

    <p>
      I need clarity. Intention is important when creating a website. What do I
      want from creating this website? What kind of message, idea, or presence
      do I want this website to hold and how is an <i>extension</i> of myself?
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "Whatever it is, there's potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop:
      when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your
      own identity."
    </div>
    <div class="notes">
      "Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and
      then, when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building
      means creating everything-not only making things inside the world, but
      also the surrounding world itself-the language, style, rules and
      architecture. This is why websites are so important. They allow the author
      to create not only works ("the objects") but also the world (the rooms,
      the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!)"
    </div>
    <p>
      Prior to meirisoda.github.io, I used tumblr as a hosting page, a website
      of sorts. Although I was posting my artworks, my thoughts and things that
      I felt was a reflection of me, it never ended up being accurate
      representation of <b>who</b> I was. I wanted to create my own website from
      the ground up, to able to control and create pages and manipulate details
      as I best saw fit - in summary, a world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt so much pride and joy after creating meirisoda.github.io. Learning
      html and css wasn't the greatest experience. But I do believe that webdev
      is a form of art and there is no reason for my website not to be an
      extension of who I am. The process of coding and seeing the site come into
      existence reminded me of the things I like to do, the slow, repetitive
      actions - the time and space I want to occupy.
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it's
      finite, often with a specific intended purpose. Simultaneously, a room can
      be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary
      partition, depending on occasion."
    </div>
    <p>
      My room is my sanctuary. It is a place that I feel safe in, and serves
      many functions. My desk has a wonderful view of the outside and lets in a
      lot of natural light, and lying in a corner are my monitors and CD player.
    </p>
    <p>
      A website can be anything. It doesn't have to be a complete archive of my
      works. I would imitate other artists' professional pages in hopes of
      feeling professional and distinguished myself, but would find myself
      feeling emptier as it didn't represent who I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there doesn't have to be a completed version of a website! It should
      grow with me.
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and
      dreams are created and expanded by them, then it's instrumental that
      websites progress along with us."
    </div>
    <p>
      Creating my own space on the web. I am constantly finding and forging my
      own space.

      Next are some pieces from <i>The Coming Age of Calm Technology</i> by Mark
      Weiser and John Seely Brown (1996):

    <div class="notes">
      "What matters is not technology itself, but its relationship to us."
    </div>
    <p>
      What role does my phone play in my life? The single piece of technology
      that holds great power over us - trying to reduce my reliance on my phone
      has proven difficult. What helped me find peace were older, often analog
      items with fixed purposes. I want specific functions for my devices, I've
      been purchasing CD players, I look into walkmans etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, the reason these devices feel a lot more natural and human, is
      because it becomes a physical manifestation or representation of the
      purpose itself. For instance, a wired headphone visually shows the music
      traveling from the source into your ears. You plug it in to begin hearing
      music. I don't know if that makes a lot of sense. But even as convenient
      wireless headphones are, wired headphones truly connect me to the music,
      and grounds me.
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "But when computers are all around, so that we want to compute while doing
      something else and have more time to be more fully human, we must
      radically rethink the goals, context and technology of the computer and
      all the other technology crowding into our lives."
    </div>
    <div class="notes">
      "Calm technology engages both the center and the periphery of our
      attention... First, by placing things in the periphery we are able to
      attune to many more things than we could if everything had to be at the
      center... Second, by recentering something formerly in the periphery we
      take control of it."
    </div>
    <p>
      I couldn't help but think about
      <i
        >Ocean of Sound: Ambient sound and radical listening in the Age of
        Communication</i
      >
      by David Toop. Some specific parts include:
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "...music in which a blankness prevails, ambient dread or bliss, clam and
      near silence, extreme minimalism, or a spacious landscape, a tropic or
      frozen atmosphere in which the listener can insert her or himself occupy
      the foreground, wander the imaginary space for hours at a time."
    </div>
    <p>This next one in particular felt special to me:</p>
    <div class="notes">
      "Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening
      attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as
      it is interesting."
    </div>
    <div class="notes">
      "...explore a restricted sound range or single technological process over
      long durations, seek to effect physiological change rather than pursue
      intellectual rigour, or depict impossible, imaginary environments of
      beauty or terror. Music that aspires to the condition of perfume, music
      that searches for new relationships between maker and listener, maker and
      machine, sound and context. Music that leads the lister into a shifting
      zone..."
    </div>
    <div class="notes">
      <b
        >"The result of calm technology is to put us at home, in a familiar
        place."</b
      >
    </div>
    <p>
      I hope that is what my website becomes. My home. A space curated for
      myself. My monitors and CDs are also home. My headphones are home. The
      partitions in my room separating my desk from my dresser. My door covering
      my clothesrack to allow for my space to be more open. They are my calm
      technology.
    </p>
    <div class="notes">
      "As we learn to design calm technology, we will enrich not only our space
      of artifacts, but also our opportunities for being with other people. When
      our world is filled with interconnected, imbedded computers, calm
      technology will play a central role in a more humanly empowered
      twenty-first century."
