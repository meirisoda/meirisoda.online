    <h2>notes</h2>
    <p> Notes is not a blog. It is titled <i>notes</i> as a way to represent my digital notebook.
    </p>

    <p> I do not separate my journals, diaries, notebooks or commonplace books, and instead prefer to have them all in one place. While there are benefits to separating them out (seen in the recent surge in popularity of commonplace books), I've found that letting myself place everything in one place reduced the barrier to entry and the feeling of <i>permanence</i> and finality that would come with a diary.

    <p> As such, my notebook becomes an extension of myself. It may contain writings surrounding world-centered topics, as well as person-centered topics from various perspectives.
    </p>

    <p> It also contains various journal/blog posts archived from previous iterations of my website (details <a href="/pages/works/other/github.html" target="_blank" class="click"   >here</a >). I have yet to compile some of my new writings, but they will be posted on this page, or on a subdirectory.
