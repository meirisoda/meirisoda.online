    <h2>meirisoda.github.io</h2>
    <p>
      meirisoda.github.io was my first website. There are many iterations, 4 of
      which are live below:
    </p>

    <div>
      <img src="/assets/works/other/github1.png" class="image" />
      <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/1" target="_blank" class="clickb"
        >meirisoda.github.io/1</a
      >
      <p>
        The first version of my website, and stylistically closest to the
        current site. As I was learning HTML, I didn't know the capabilities of
        CSS, and as such, the code is very messy (it is still messy).
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <img src="/assets/works/other/github2.png" class="image" />
      <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/2" target="_blank" class="clickb"
        >meirisoda.github.io/2</a
      >
      <p>
        Personally, my least favorite version. Lacks a cohesive body and
        unifying idea, and was a shallow attempt at creating a minimalist and
        "professional" website, ending up not representing me or my values at
        all.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <img src="/assets/works/other/github3.png" class="image" />
      <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/3" target="_blank" class="clickb"
        >meirisoda.github.io/3</a
      >
      — This version of the website served as an experiment - both in what I
      could achieve from a website, but also for my identity.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <img src="/assets/works/other/github4.png" class="image" />
      <a href="https://meirisoda.github.io/4" target="_blank" class="clickb"
        >meirisoda.github.io/4</a
      >
      — Built off /3, this version is my personal favorite and what I think
      looks the most polished.
