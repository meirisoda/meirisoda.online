## Learning to Love
_November 11, 2022 â€” edited from original post_

The weather's getting colder and gloomier every day. I can definitely feel it affecting my mood and my general mental health, and it feels like I'm walking through fog. I don't want to be so gloomy but I can't help but feel that way.

I have been learning how to love though. Love can mean a variety of things, but it also includes showing the people around me that I care and making them feel appreciated. People do frequently tell me to reach out more, but it's always been a difficult thing for me. I realized that the way I comfort people may not actually make them feel better. I want to work on how I show appreciation, how I comfort others, how I show my feelings to others - in a healthy way for both myself and the other person.
